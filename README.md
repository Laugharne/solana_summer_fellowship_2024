# Solana Summer Fellowship 2024

![](assets/ssf2024.png)

Excited to introduce the [**Solana Summer Fellowship 2024**](https://summer.superteam.fun/) A hands on **8-week program** for the best developers to learn **building on Solana**. On top of that, each fellow will get a $2000 stipend for the fellowship as well.

From Gaming to NFTs, and DeFi to DAO tooling, weeks will be centred around a theme, and there will be guided quests, exercises, and a Q&A session by an expert in that space, helping fellows not only build but get exposure to open opportunities in the space.

The fellowship ends with a **Demo Day**, which brings an opportunity to receive grants, funding, or otherwise work with the hottest projects in the Solana ecosystem.

It requires a fully functional Anchor program and its associated tests.
The program must imperatively pass its own test units successfully.
The goal is precisely to disrupt the test units in order to be able to detect flaws!<br /><br />
<b>Mutation testing</b> is a technique used to evaluate and improve the quality of your unit tests.
It involves introducing small changes (mutations) to your code, and then checking if your tests can detect these changes by failing.<br /><br />
