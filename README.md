# Solana Summer Fellowship 2024

![](2024-08-18-09-32-58.png)

Excited to introduce the [**Solana Summer Fellowship 2024**](https://summer.superteam.fun/) A hands on **8-week program** for the best developers to learn **building on Solana**. On top of that, each fellow will get a $2000 stipend for the fellowship as well.

From Gaming to NFTs, and DeFi to DAO tooling, weeks will be centred around a theme, and there will be guided quests, exercises, and a Q&A session by an expert in that space, helping fellows not only build but get exposure to open opportunities in the space.

The fellowship ends with a Demo Day, which brings an opportunity to receive grants, funding, or otherwise work with the hottest projects in the Solana ecosystem.
